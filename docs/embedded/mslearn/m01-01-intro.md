# Microsoft SharePoint repository services - Overview & Configuration

Microsoft SharePoint repository services provides a faster way to build file and document focused apps. SharePoint repository services are powered by SharePoint and make it easy for every developer, independent software vendor (ISV), and enterprise, to include critical Microsoft 365 file and document capabilities in every app they build.

In this module, you’ll learn what’s possible with SharePoint repository services, determine if it’s right for your next document-based application, and create your first SharePoint repository services container.
