# Set up your SharePoint site with lists and libraries

To successfully complete the *Getting Started* tutorials, set up your SharePoint site with the following items.

## Projects list
Create a new SharePoint list called **Projects**. To create a new SharePoint list, follow these steps.

### Create a new list

> **Note:** You can use either a modern Teams site or a Communications site.
  
2. In the command bar, select **New** > **List**.

3. In the **Create list** panel, enter the following:

    * **Name**: Projects
    * **Description**: Projects list
    
4. To create the list, select **Create**
    
    You are automatically redirected to the **Projects** list.

5. Select **+ Add column**, and to add an **Owner** column to the list, and then select the **Person** column type.

6. In the **Create a column** panel, enter the following:

    * **Name**: Owner
    * **Description**: Project owner
    
7. To add the column to the Projects list, select **Save**. The new **Owner** column becomes available in the **Projects** list.

### Add new project items

In the List command bar, select **New**, and add the following list items:

* Item 1
  * **Title**: Project 1
