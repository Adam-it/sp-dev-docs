# Overview of Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions
Bot Powered Adaptive Card Extensions (ACEs) for Microsoft Viva Connections are a new technology to extend the Microsoft Viva Connections Dashboard using the Bot development model. Bot Powered ACEs are an addition to the already existing Viva Connections extensibility model, which is based on SharePoint Framework (SPFx) components. While with SPFx components you create client-side solutions to extend Viva Connections, using the Bot Powered ACEs you can apply server-side solutions. Depending on your goals, expertise, and scenario you can choose between these two options that are complementary and not alternative.

In the following picture, you can see an Adaptive Card Extension to collect user's feedback in action in the desktop experience of Viva Connection Dashboard. The ACE was implemented as a Bot Powered ACE.
