# Designing Viva Connections custom cards for your dashboard

## Principles

Cards are used to link resources, surface information, and power direct interaction with applications.

**Integrate rather than duplicate:** Take advantage of the experiences already available on your intranet, such as task assignments and completion, shift schedules, company policies, and more.

**Stay in context:** Design cards to avoid making users jump around to different experiences. For example, it's ideal if you can keep interactions within the Viva Connections app using Quick view (link to quick view page here). Next best is to keep user interactions within the dashboard.

**Bring cards to life with relevant and dynamically refreshable data:** Company stock price, due dates for training or projects, task assignment updates, and remaining vacation days are some examples.
