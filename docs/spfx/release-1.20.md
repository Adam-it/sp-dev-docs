### HTML Quick View support for Viva Connections cards

With the 1.20 version, we are introducing new option to use HTML to render the Viva Connection Adaptive Card Extension quick views. This will enable more advance user experiences and you can use whatever suitable JavaScript extensibility model (React etc.) in your quick view experiences.

You can start using this option by updating your quick view implementation to be inherited from xxx class, which will be automatically detected by the underlaying platform.

Out-of-the-box OneDrive (files) card is using this rendering option as a reference point.
