# Overview of SharePoint Framework Extensions

You can use SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Extensions to extend the SharePoint user experience. With SPFx Extensions, you can customize more facets of the SharePoint experience, including notification areas, toolbars, and list data views and forms. SPFx Extensions are available in all Microsoft 365 subscriptions for production usage.

SPFx Extensions enable you to extend the SharePoint user experience within modern pages and document libraries, while using the familiar SPFx tools and libraries for client-side development. Specifically, the SPFx includes four extension types:

- **Application Customizers**: Adds scripts to the page, and accesses well-known HTML element placeholders and extends them with custom renderings.
- **Field Customizers**: Provides modified views to data for fields within a list.
- **Command Sets**: Extends the SharePoint command surfaces to add new actions, and provides client-side code that you can use to implement behaviors.
- **Form Customizer**: Provides a way to assoicate and override default new, edit and view form experience of list and libraries with custom forms by associating component to content type .

You can build extensions alongside common scripting frameworks, such as Angular and React, or to plain JavaScript projects. For example, you can use React along with components from Office UI Fabric React to create experiences based on the same components used in Microsoft 365.
