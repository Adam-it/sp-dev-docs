## Breadcrumb properties on Office Documents from SharePoint repository services Apps 
Breadcrumb properties are used by Office clients to display breadcrumb-style elements within Office client UI that aid your users in associating Office files with your Application. 

> **_NOTE:_**  We recommend specifying 'Current Channel' to take advantage of Breadcrumb patterns and future enhancements to Office Apps. Learn more about [specifying update channels for Office Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/updates/overview-update-channels)

Breadcrumb patterns for SharePoint repository services Apps are constructed from Container properties configured for your Apps. The following diagram maps the container properties to breadcrumb presentation in Office clients.
